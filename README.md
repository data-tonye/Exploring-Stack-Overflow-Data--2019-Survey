# Exploring-Stack-Overflow-Data--2019-Survey
This project analysis Stack Overflow survey data for 2019. It gives insights into the people in the tech industry.

## Libraries used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn
- Seaborn
- Scipy.stats
- Matplot Lib
Note: Scikit Learn is present for further work which can be done on this project. I was initially used but due to capacity of my local machine, some commands took too long so I decided not to use it but kept the library

## Motivation
The tech industry is booming and for lot of young people they will like to learn skills like programming to fit into the workplace. To do this requires some level of education as well as techincal skills. I wanted to investigate the degree requirements to be employed as we often hear that at times a university degree is not so important in getting a tech job. Also I wanted to know if these individuals were satisfied with their jobs. The Stack Overflow data was the best bet as the company is globally used by industry experts and novice to learn and share knowledge as well as start careers. With this data I could get some understanding of the sector.

## Files in repo

- Analysis files:

## Results
I found out that Bachelors and Master degrees are popular with people in the tech industry and to be employed full-time you should have at least a Bachelor's degree. Most people were slightly satisfied with the jobs for both full-time and part-time jobs but when it came to freelance, they were very satisfied. Also from analysis, I discovered that job satisfaction and career satisfaction positively correlated although it was not as strong as I hoped. Relationships beween Compensation and the other numerical data weren't found and so I didn't go forward with modelling and predicting.
